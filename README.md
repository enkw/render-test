# üìñ Deploy an Express.js App to Render

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a web developer, I want to deploy my application to services like Render so that I can share my app with the world.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have initialized a Git repository by running `git init` at the root of my existing project.

* It's done when I have added the `PORT` variable in `server.js` according to the Render documentation.

* It's done when I have pushed my code to a new GitHub repository.

* It's done when I have connected Render with my GitHub account.

* It's done when I have setup an automatic deployment process on Render to the `main` branch of my repo.

* It's done after I have confirmed that the application was deployed successfully by visiting the resulting URL e.g. `example.onRender.com`.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on deploying to Render.](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/render/render-deployment-guide).

Refer to the documentation:

[Render documentation on setting environment variables](https://docs.render.com/configure-environment-variables)

[Render documentation on linking Github](https://docs.render.com/github)

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you create an app from the dashboard on Render instead of connecting it to GitHub and using that pipeline?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
